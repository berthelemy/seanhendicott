text: Thanks again to Sean for the fire job. Dave was very pleased when he came home with it. I will certainly recommend Sean if anyone asks me, also we will be contacting Sean for a digging job later near summer which I discussed with him while he was here. Also could you send us any info on wind turbines as Dave is interested in having one. Many thanks again.
