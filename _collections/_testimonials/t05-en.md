text: We would just like to share our joy with you; we have today received a cheque from the tax office for 1507â‚¬ our Credit D'Impot for the woodburner etc. Many thanks for all your help in providing all the relevant paperwork to enable us to make our tax credit claim. I have to say I didn't think it would be that easy!
