text: Hi Karen and Sean, Please find attached the photo of the Wood Burner as promised. It is marvellous, we aren't dreading the Winter this year! Central heating also great now, not that we need it much anymore as the Wood Burner is so efficient! We are absolutely delighted with the Wood Burner, it's so easy to use, hardly uses any fuel and we are SO warm. All in all it is fantastic. Thank you so much for the very efficient way you have dealt with all this for me, it's been a pleasure doing business with you, and Sean is a Genius!
