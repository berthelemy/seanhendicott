description: 'We installed a Villager BH woodburner'
text: Massive thanks to both of you for organising our woodburner installation and for doing such a great job last week. We lit it for the first time on Saturday and it was lovely. It looks magical and we were warm as toast. It really makes our cottage seem like a proper home now and I'm sure we'll be getting tons of use from it in the future. It's been a pleasure working with both of you in getting it put in and we wanted to say how grateful both of us are.
