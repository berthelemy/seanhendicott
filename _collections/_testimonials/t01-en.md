description: "We installed Mr Snell's own Rayburn with back boiler"
text: Just to let you know that the new system is working, and exceeding expectation. The house is warm and the water is hot. The Yorkshire puds are the best we've had for a very long time. So a big thank you. With a bit of experimentation we're getting a grasp on how to tweak the system. All the best and thanks again - really improved our life here!
