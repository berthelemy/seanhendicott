### Central heating
  
Central heating installations of any kind are possible - you can have whatever you want!

Installations vary so much between houses and systems. So it's best to have a chat with Sean regarding your individual requirements and the most economic and efficient way they might be catered for.

We will then provide a fully detailed quote (devis), with all parts and labour listed separately.
