<p>The Esse Ironheart Wood Burning Cooker burns logs beautifully and cooks to perfection. Essentially the Esse Ironheart cooking stove makes the most of the two things Esse does best – an inspired combination of a superb log burning stove and a traditional cast iron range cooker.</p>

<p>The Esse Ironheart solid fuel cooker was launched in 2004 to celebrate 150 years of ESSE Cookers and Stoves by embodying the quintessential features of both product types and remains a best seller. The Esse Ironheart is the stove designed for cooking and when the famous River Cottage UK wanted a stove, this was a natural choice.</p>

<div class="col_6">
<p>The Esse Ironheart wood burner has a firebox that has been specifically designed to burn 500mm logs lengthways, which it does in a spectacular fashion providing a splendid view of the flames through a large rectangular glass fire door.</p>

<p>As the heat source for the oven and hotplates, the Esse Ironheart is highly controllable, thanks to simple but effective primary and secondary air flow controls. The secondary control provides an airwash which keeps the door glass clear.</p>

<h3>EcoDesign</h3>

<div class="col_6">

<p>Updated in line with the new EcoDesign requirements ESSE Ironheart is now EcoDesign Ready.</p>

<p>Enjoy watching the flames leap and flicker through the large clear glass window while it heats and cooks.</p>

<p>Ironheart has panels that radiate warmth like a wood-burning stove. The oven has an almost 50 litre capacity, and you can also cook directly in the firebox with the BBQ rack & grill.</p>

<p>With the “dog bone” hotplate comfortably able to take up to six pans, the Ironheart is equipped to bring out the very best in creative cooks – so no wonder it’s become a firm favourite at Park Farm, River Cottage HQ.</p>
