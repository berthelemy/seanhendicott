Sean is able to offer sound advice and system design on most aspects of heating systems for the home.

He began his career 35 years ago in Cornwall with a 5 year apprenticeship in plant &amp; machinery, hydraulic engineering and electrical.

From there he worked and became self employed in the UK as a plant fitter and hydraulic engineer for 17 years.

Sensing a change was due, he returned to college to study Oil Fired Boilers and unvented hot water systems. After gaining his tickets, he became OFTEC registered and set out as an oil central heating &amp; system design engineer in the UK.

After an exciting move to France in 2003, the French 'chambre des metiers' recognised his UK qualifications. So he began to specialise in all aspects of French heating - with an especially keen interest in renewable energy and 'off grid'.

He has since completed 'stages' here in France.
