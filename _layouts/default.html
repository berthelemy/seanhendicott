            <p>Sean began his career 35 years ago in Cornwall with a 5 year apprenticeship in plant &amp; machinery, hydraulic engineering and electrical.</p>
            <p>From there he worked and became self employed in the UK as a plant fitter and hydraulic engineer for 17 years.</p>
            <p>Sensing a change was due, he returned to college to study Oil Fired Boilers and unvented hot water systems. After gaining his tickets, he became OFTEC registered and set out as an oil central heating &amp; system design engineer in the UK.</p>
            <p>After an exciting move to France in 2003, the French 'chambre des metiers' recognised his UK qualifications. So he began to specialise in all aspects of French heating - with an especially keen interest in renewable energy and 'off grid'.</p>
            <p>He has since completed 'stages' here in France and is now able to offer sound advice and system design on most aspects of heating systems for the home.</p>

            <h4>Mr &amp; Mrs Snell, Bain</h4>
            <p>We installed Mr Snell's own Rayburn with back boiler</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Hi Both, Just to let you know that the new system is working, and exceeding, expectation. The house is warm and the water is hot. The Yorkshire puds are the best we've had for a very long time. So a big thank you. With a bit of experimentation we're getting a grasp on how to tweak the system. All the best and thanks again - really improved our life here!</p>

Mrs Anne Thompson, Rostrenen 26/10/14 - a fully automatic system with woodburner & oil boiler

Thankyou for everything, never had so many windows and doors open in October it was so hot!

Regards Anne & George

 
 
Mr Alan & Chloe Boyce, Holiday home @ St Hernin
 A Villager BH woodburner was installed

'Hi Karen ( & Sean!)

Massive thanks to both of you for organising our woodburner installation and for doing such a great job last week.

We lit it for the first time on Saturday and it was lovely. It looks magical and we were warm as toast.

It really makes our cottage seem like a proper home now and i'm sure we'll be getting tons of use from it in the future.

It's been a pleasure working with both of you in getting it put in and we wanted to say how grateful both of us are.

All the best!

Chloe'

 

Mrs Sue Gilbert, Le Petit Moulin, Huelgoat

Where we installed a Cashin V8 woodburner (below) & altered the central heating system......

 'Hi Karen and Sean,
 Please find attached the photo of the Wood Burner as promised.
 It is marvellous, we aren't dreading the Winter this year!
 Central heating also great now, not that we need it much anymore as the Wood Burner is so efficient!
 We are absolutely delighted with the Wood Burner, it's so easy to use, hardly uses any fuel and we are SO warm. All in all it is fantastic.
 Thank you so much for the very efficient way you have dealt with all this for me, it's been a pleasure doing business with you, and Sean is a Genius!

All the best and thanks again for everything,
Sue'


Mr & Mrs Ian & Gail Trew, Rostrenen

We would just like to share our joy with you; we have today received a cheque from the tax office for 1507â‚¬ our Credit D'Impot for the woodburner etc.

Many thanks for all your help in providing all the relevant paperwork to enable us to make our tax credit claim. I have to say I didnt think it would be that easy!

Happy Plumbing!

Ian & Gail Trew

p.s we are only sharing our joy with you, not the loot!!

 

 Mr & Mrs Dave Middleton, Duault

They had a Villager Puffin in a wooden built house, necessitating a complete new installation of an insulated flue...see photos & email received below.

'Thanks again to Sean for the fire job, Dave was very pleased when he came home with it. I will certainly recommend Sean if anyone asks me, also we will be contacting Sean for a digging job later near summer which I discussed with him while he was here. Also could you send us any info on wind turbines as Dave is interested in having one. Many thanks again.'
