            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Sean began his career 35 years ago in Cornwall with a 5 year apprenticeship with ECLP Western Excavating (as it was then) in plant &amp; machinery, hydraulic engineering &amp; electrical.</p>
            <p>From there he worked and became self employed in the UK as a plant fitter and hydraulic engineer for 17 years.</p>
            <p>Sensing a change was due, he returned to college to study Oil Fired Boilers and unvented hot water systems, &amp; after gaining his tickets, became OFTEC registered and set out as an oil central heating &amp; system design engineer in the UK.</p>
            <p>After an exciting move to France in 2003, the French 'chambre des metiers' recognised his UK qualifications &amp; so he began to specialise in all aspects of French heating - with an especially keen interest in renewable energy &amp; 'off grid'.</p>
            <p>He has since completed 'stages' here in France and is now able to offer sound advice and system design on most aspects of heating systems for the home.</p>
