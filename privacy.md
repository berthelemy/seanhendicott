This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or complete a contact form on https://seanhendicott.com (the “Site”).

### Personal information we collect
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
- Additionally when you complete our contact form, we collect your name and email address in order to return your message.

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Contact Information.

### How do we use your personal information?

We use your contact information to:

- communicate with you
- when in line with the preferences you have shared with us, to provide you with information or advertising relating to additional products or services.
- We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).

### Sharing your personal information

We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.

Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

Additionally, please note that your information may be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

### Data retention

When you communicate with us, we will maintain your Personal Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.
